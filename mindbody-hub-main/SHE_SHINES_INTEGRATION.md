- Proper heading levels (h1, h2, h3)
- Muted text for descriptions
- Emoji integration maintained

## Data Management

### Local Storage Keys
- `sheShines_moods` - Array of mood entries
- `sheShines_journals` - Array of journal entries
- `sheShines_tips` - Array of generated tips
- `sheShines_darkMode` - Boolean theme preference

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface MoodEntry {
  mood: string;
  date: string;
}

interface JournalEntry {
  journal: string;
  date: string;
}

interface TipEntry {
  tip: string;
  date: string;
}
```

## Navigation Integration

### Routes
- **Main Route**: `/she-shines`
- **Navigation**: Added to main header with flower emoji
- **Promotional Section**: Added to main dashboard

### User Flow
1. User sees She Shines section on main dashboard
2. Clicks "Explore She Shines" or navigation link
3. Navigates to dedicated She Shines page
4. Can return to main dashboard via browser back or navigation

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: Single column layout, stacked buttons
- **Tablet**: Two-column grid for action buttons
- **Desktop**: Four-column grid for action buttons

### Mobile Optimizations
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Readable text at all screen sizes
- Proper spacing for mobile interaction

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Enhanced Modal System**: Replace alerts with proper modal dialogs
2. **PDF Generation**: Integrate jsPDF library for proper PDF export
3. **Data Visualization**: Add charts for mood trends
4. **Reminders**: Add notification system for daily check-ins
5. **Social Features**: Optional sharing capabilities
6. **Backup/Sync**: Cloud storage integration

### Technical Debt
- Consider extracting data management to custom hooks
- Add proper error boundaries
- Implement loading states for data operations
- Add unit tests for She Shines functionality
